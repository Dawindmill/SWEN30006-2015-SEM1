### Exact Output Specifications

We will match these, and only these, output specifications when testing your program. This is a broader list than the original specification allowed as a number of people have requested different output types because of style concerns etc.

If your output does not match these your input **will** fail
the automated testing. There will be an error margin applied when matching numbers to account for differences in rounding.

## Linear
-29.18x + 10
29.18x + -10
29.18x - 10

## Polynomial
```
-9.0x^4 + 3x^2 - 10.3x + 21.9
9.0x^4 + 0.00x^3 + 3x^2 + -10.3x + 21.9
0.00x^2 - 10.3x + 21.9
```
> Note: you can chose to print or not print the 0 terms.

## Exponential
```
-10*e^12.1x
-10*e^(12.1x)
10*e^12.1x
10e^12.1x
```

> Note: you can chose to include or omitt the brackets around the e power and chose to include or omitt the asterisk between the constant and e.

## Logarithmic
```
10*ln(x) + 18.9
10ln(x) + 18.9
-10ln(x) - 18.9
-10*ln(x) + -18.9
```

> Note: you can chose to include or omitt the asterisk between the constant and ln.
